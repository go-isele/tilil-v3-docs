## Getting Delivery Reports:

1. **Offline (Pulling â€“ Not recommended)**

   This is a pull method where a client requests a delivery report from the system by specifying a message id in the request. The URL below will return a delivery report for message id 288369252.

Where:

| Value                 | Name                 | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `288369252`           | Message Id           | Used when querying delivery reports                                                                      |
| `Success`             | Request Status       | A status description for a successful request                                                            |
| `1`                   | Delivery Status      | This can be used by developers for easy indexing of delivery statuses                                    |
| `DeliveredToTerminal` | Delivery Description | Full description of the delivery status                                                                  |
| `2020-05-13 08:47:03` | Delivery Date/Time   | When the message was actually delivered to the end user                                                  |
| `00:00:06`            | TAT                  | The turn around time. From when a message was scheduled up to the time it was delivered to the end user. |

## 2. Online (Recommended)

This is the recommended method of getting delivery reports. A partner specifies a delivery reports callback URL from the portal. All delivery reports sent through an API will be pushed to the URL automatically.

Below is a PHP sample that can be hosted by the client to receive delivery report notifications. Note that the client has to implement the Business Logic for example:

- Updating a local sent message
- Storing the delivery report for later processing
- Generate a report or an alert for support monitoring

```php
<?php
$data_json = file_get_contents('php://input');
$data_array = json_decode($data_json);

if (!$data_array) {
    die("0;error;unsupported data type");
}

$messageId = $data_array->messageId;
$dlrTime = $data_array->dlrTime;
$dlrStatus = $data_array->dlrStatus;
$dlrDesc = $data_array->dlrDesc;
$tat = $data_array->tat;
$network = $data_array->network;

// YOUR BUSINESS LOGIC

// END YOUR LOGIC: if all goes well echo 'OK' otherwise echo 'FAILED' for the system to retry
echo "OK;$messageId;$dlrDesc;$network";
?>
```
